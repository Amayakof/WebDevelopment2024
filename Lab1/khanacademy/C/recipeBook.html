        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Prepare dough: Place milk, eggs, margarine, flour, salt, white sugar, and yeast in the pan of a bread machine in the order recommended by the manufacturer. Select dough cycle; press Start.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2: </strong>When dough has doubled in size, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Cover it with a kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let it rest for 10 minutes.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 3: </strong>Roll dough on a lightly floured surface to a 16x21-inch rectangle.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 4: </strong>Prepare filling: Combine brown sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl. Spread softened butter over the dough, then sprinkle cinnamon-sugar mixture evenly over top.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 5: </strong>Starting at the longer end, roll up the dough; cut into 12 rolls. Place rolls in a lightly greased 9x13-inch baking pan. Cover and let rise until nearly doubled, about 30 minutes.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 6: </strong>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</p>
        <p><strong>Step 7: </strong>Bake rolls in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 8: </strong>While rolls are baking, prepare icing: Beat confectioners' sugar, butter, cream cheese, confectioners' sugar, vanilla, and salt until creamy.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 9: </strong>Spread icing on warm rolls before serving.</p>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Prepare the cream: Using an electric mixer in a large bowl, whip together egg yolks and ¼ cup/50 grams sugar until very pale yellow and about tripled in volume. A slight ribbon should fall from the beaters (or whisk attachment) when lifted from the bowl. Set aside.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2: </strong>In a medium bowl, whip cream and remaining ¼ cup/50 grams sugar until it creates soft peaks. Add mascarpone and continue to whip until it creates a soft, spreadable mixture with medium peaks. Gently fold the mascarpone mixture into the sweetened egg yolks until combined.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 3: </strong>For the assembly, combine espresso and rum in a shallow bowl and set aside.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 4: </strong>Using a sifter, dust the bottom of a 2-quart baking dish (an 8x8-inch dish, or a 9-inch round cake pan would also work here) with 1 tablespoon cocoa powder.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 5: </strong>Working one at a time, quickly dip each ladyfinger into the espresso mixture -- they are quite porous and will fall apart if left in the liquid too long -- and place them rounded side up at the bottom of the baking dish. Repeat, using half the ladyfingers, until you’ve got an even layer, breaking the ladyfingers in half as needed to fill in any obvious gaps (a little space in between is O.K.). Spread half the mascarpone mixture onto the ladyfingers in one even layer. Repeat with remaining espresso-dipped ladyfingers and mascarpone mixture.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 6: </strong>Dust top layer with remaining tablespoon of cocoa powder. Cover with plastic wrap and let chill in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours (if you can wait 24 hours, all the better). Top with shaved or finely grated chocolate, if desired, then slice or scoop to serve.</p>

            <h2>Directions</h2>
            <p><strong>Step 1: </strong>To Make the Éclair Shells: Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 350°F (177°C). To prepare a template for your éclairs, take one sheet of parchment paper and, using a ruler as a guide and a Sharpie for easily visible lines, draw twelve 4 1/2-inch long lines that are 2 inches apart. Flip paper upside down and set it on an aluminum half-sheet tray. Repeat with a second piece of parchment paper and sheet tray.</p>
            <p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Pipe a small amount of choux paste under each corner of parchment paper (the dough acts as a glue and keeps the paper in place as you pipe).</p>
            <p><strong>Step 3: </strong>Pipe the first tray of éclair shells: Holding the bag at a 45° angle, lightly drag the tip along the surface of the paper and apply steady downward pressure, while slowly piping a 1-inch wide line of choux following a single line on the template. To stop piping, cease applying pressure and move the pastry tip up and over toward the opposite end of the éclair before completely lifting away. Continue to pipe until tray is full. To smooth out the surface of any uneven éclairs, dip a finger into cold water and gently pat down any bumps. Coat éclairs evenly with cooking spray.</p>
            <p><strong>Step 4: </strong>Bake first tray until éclair shells are puffed, golden brown, and hollow feeling, about 30 minutes. While first tray of éclair shells are baking, repeat Step 3 for the second tray of éclair shells. As soon as first tray are fully baked, remove from oven and set second tray in oven to bake.</p>
            <p><strong>Step 5: </strong>Working quickly while first tray of éclairs are still hot, make two 1/4-inch holes on the underside of each éclair (one near each end) by gently inserting the tip of a paring knife and rotating in a circular motion, then return to tray.</p>
            <p><strong>Step 6: </strong>As soon as second tray of éclairs are baked, repeat Step 5. Return both trays to the turned-off but still warm oven with the door partially open for 30 minutes.</p>
            <p><strong>Step 7: </strong>To Fill the Éclairs: Working one éclair at a time, insert tip of pastry cream–filled bag into a hole in each éclair shell and begin piping with steady pressure until filled (pastry cream will start to overflow the hole). Repeat with other hole. Wipe away any excess pastry cream. Repeat until all éclairs are filled.</p>
            <p><strong>Step 8: </strong>To Make the Glaze: Combine chocolate, butter, corn syrup, and salt in a wide, shallow microwave-safe bowl. Microwave in 15 second increments, stirring after each increment, until chocolate is melted and mixture is completely smooth, about 1 minute in total.</p>
            <p><strong>Step 9: </strong>Working one at a time, hold each éclair upside down and carefully dip the top in the glaze, then return to tray. Repeat with remaining éclairs. Allow glaze to set, about 30 minutes. Serve immediately.</p>

            <h3>Notes: </h3>
            <p>For the choux pastry, combine 1/2 cup (115g) milk and 1/2 cup (115g) water to get 1 cup of liquid. If you don’t have milk, feel free to use 1 cup (235g) water; the éclairs will just bake up more tan in color than golden brown.</p>
            <p>If you don’t have a microwave, you can make the glaze in a double boiler. Place 2 1/2 cups water in a 3-quart saucier on the stove over medium heat. In a large, heat-proof bowl that will sit comfortably on the pot without toppling over or touching the water below, combine chocolate, butter, corn syrup, and salt. Stir gently until chocolate and butter are melted and the glaze is smooth and shiny.</p>
