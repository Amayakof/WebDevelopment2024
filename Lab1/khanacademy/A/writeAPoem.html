    <p>
    Have you seen that man?<br>
    Broken pieces of his plan<br>
    Taken by the wind<br>
    To the place where you have been<br>
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Corner of the room<br>
    I think I saw your brother moon<br>
    He came out of the grey<br>
    He was sad, but that's okay<br>
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Windmill, are you still afraid of <i>nothing?</i><br>
    Are you still afraid of <i>something?</i> (Is the wind still your friend?)<br>
    Are you still afraid of wind? (Is it you who command?)<br>
    Oh, Windmill, you're a place where I can cry<br>
    You're a place where I can lie (If I want, when I'm sad)<br>
    You're a place where I can die (when I'm tired, when I'm down)
    </p>
