        <strong><em>Nobody’s</em> born smart.</strong> We all start at 0. Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly <em>can’t do</em> algebra.<br>
        <h1></h1>
        Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. <strong><em>Nobody’s</em> good at anything at first.</strong><br>
        <h1></h1>
        There was a time when <em>Einstein</em> couldn’t count to 10.<br>
        <h1></h1>
        And <em>Shakespeare</em> had to learn his ABCs <em>just like the rest of us.</em><br>
        <h1></h1>
        Thankfully, <strong><em>we are born to learn.</em></strong><br>
        <h1></h1>
        Slowly. Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
        <h1></h1>
        <i>Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.</i><br>
        <h1></h1>
        <strong>Until one day, you walk.</strong><br>
        <h1></h1>
        One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
        <h1></h1>
        Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger.<br>
        <h1></h1>
        Failing is just another word for growing. And you keep going.<br>
        <h1></h1>
        <strong>This. is. learning.</strong><br>
        <h1></h1>
        It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
        <h1></h1>
        <strong>You just don’t get it, <em>yet</em>.</strong>
        Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
        <h1></h1>
        Are built on basic ideas that <em>anyone, anywhere can understand.</em><br>
        <h1></h1>
        <strong><em>Whoever</em> you are, <em>wherever</em> you are.</strong><br>
        </p>
        <p>
        You only have to know <em>one</em> thing:<br>
        <h1></h1>
        <strong><em>You can learn anything.</em></strong>
