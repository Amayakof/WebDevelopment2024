    <h2>What plants are best for your health?</h2>    
    <p>
        The healthiest houseplant is the one that matches your personal style as well as daily schedule and routine, says Alex Cromer, LPC, a licensed professional mental health counselor with Thriveworks in Richmond, Virginia. And, don’t worry too much if you don’t have a green thumb! Many of the best plants for your health are easy to care for, so you can enjoy their presence and reap the health rewards.

    <h2>Spider Plant</h2>
    <p>Spider plants, or Chlorophytum comosum, are extremely easy to grow, don’t require constant attention and thrive with little investment on your behalf. The plants have narrow leaves and get their name from the “small plantlets produced on long trailing stems that vaguely resemble spiders,” according to the University of Wisconsin-Madison Division of Extension.</p>
    <p>Spider plants are known to help purify the surrounding air. NASA research examined the leaves, soil, roots and microorganisms of several houseplants and found that plants can act as a natural air filter to reduce pollutants. The study indicates that spider plants removed 95% of toxic formaldehyde from the air in a sealed Plexiglas container over a 24-hour period.</p>

    <h2>Peace Lily</h2>
    <p>The name “peace lily” definitely evokes a sense of calm. These sturdy plants also “flower and are aesthetically pleasing” and may benefit your health over time, explains Trevor Cates, N.D, a naturopathic doctor in Park City, Utah, and author of Clean Skin From Within. A 2022 study published in Applied Sciences suggests that peace lilies have air-cleaning properties and help to remove carbon dioxide and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from the air.</p>
    <p>Peace lilies can live for years and continuously produce broad white flowers that resemble a white peace flag, per materials published by MiracleGro. They’re easy to take care of and don’t need much light, so they’re perfect for shady spaces. Just keep them out of reach from pets and small children, as they can cause vomiting or tongue swelling if they’re ingested.</p>

    <h2>Rubber Plants</h2>
    <p>Rubber plants — also known as rubber trees or Ficus elastica — make for great indoor houseplants. They’re generally easy to take care of and only need to be watered every week or so, according to materials shared by The Sill. Research shows that rubber plants feature air-purifying properties. Just be sure to keep them firmly away from any pets and from young children, as they're known to be highly toxic when ingested.</p>
